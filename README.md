# URL Shortener Microservice

This is the boilerplate code for the URL Shortener Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice.

I, [Tanuke Sensei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanukesensei/), developed the code so that the api would work correctly, both for personal training in creating APIs and for obtaining the course certificate.
